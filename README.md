![I am a Front-End Developer](https://arturssmirnovs.github.io/github-profile-readme-generator/images/banner.png)

I love coding, especially in JavaScript. However, I love learning new things constantly, so I never stop trying interesting technologies. I currently focus on frontend development, but I will become a FullStack developer soon, as I like to think that boundaries are set by us, and I have no limits to my capabilities.

Skills: ReactJS / Node / JS / HTML / CSS / Typescript / SASS 

- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning NodeJS
