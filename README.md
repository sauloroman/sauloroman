I love coding, especially in JavaScript. However, I love learning new things constantly, so I never stop trying interesting technologies. I currently focus on frontend development, but I will become a FullStack developer soon, as I like to think that boundaries are set by us, and I have no limits to my capabilities.

Please feel free to give me your comments and recomendations. I really try to improve and I'm willing to share what I know with you.
